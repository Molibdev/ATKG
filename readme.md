### Description

Welcome to Against the Keyboard game! To start, let me give you a brief explanation of how it works.

The game is divided into 3 difficulties (Easy, Medium, Hard). Depending on the difficulty, you will face a different number of battles against the keyboard.

In Easy, there are between 6 to 8 words, in Medium, there are 10 to 14 words, and in Hard, there are 14 to 16 words.

You will have to type the letters to complete the words that appear on the screen, but be careful.

The main mechanic is that if you type a letter, for example, the letter A, and the next word contains the same letter in the same position, it will also fill in.

So be cautious and enjoy the game. You can register your score at the end of each game.
